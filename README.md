Title:

AI-Powered Voice Chatbot for Call Support (Python, OpenAI/Gemini, Agents SDK)

Description:

I have developed a professional AI-powered voice chatbot designed for call support and customer service automation. This solution leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) using OpenAI/Gemini APIs and an agent-based SDK to deliver seamless, real-time voice interactions.

Key Features:

1- Voice Interaction: 
Users can speak directly to the chatbot, which understands and responds using speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies.

2- Multi-Agent Architecture: 
Specialized agents handle customer service and technical support queries, coordinated by a main chatbot agent for efficient and context-aware responses.

3- Contextual Conversation:
Maintains conversation history for natural, ongoing dialogue.

4- Python Implementation:
Built with Python for flexibility, scalability, and easy integration.

5- Customizable:
Easily extendable to include more agents, knowledge bases, or integrate with other APIs.

This project demonstrates expertise in AI, NLP, Python, and modular chatbot development, and is ideal for businesses seeking to automate and enhance their customer support experience.
