AI-Powered Call Support Chatbot Development

Hello,
I am excited to submit my proposal for your project seeking an AI Chatbot Developer for Call Support. I have hands-on experience in building advanced AI chatbots that handle real-time voice interactions, leveraging the latest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Project Overview
I have developed a robust AI-powered chatbot system that can:
Listen to users via voice input (using SpeechRecognition)
Understand and process natural language queries (using OpenAI/Gemini APIs)
Respond with human-like synthesized speech (using pyttsx3)
Handle both customer service and technical support queries through specialized agents
Maintain conversation history for context-aware and seamless interactions
Technical Highlights
Python-based implementation for flexibility and easy integration
Modular agent architecture: Separate agents for customer service and technical support, coordinated by a main chatbot agent
Voice-to-text and text-to-voice pipeline for natural, call-like user experience
OpenAI/Gemini integration for state-of-the-art NLP and AI responses
Easily extendable: Can integrate with other AI providers (such as IBM Watson) if required by your business
