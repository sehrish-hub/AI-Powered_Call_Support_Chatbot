 ðŸš€ Just Built: AI-Powered Voice Chatbot for Call Support (Python, OpenAI/Gemini, Agents SDK)
I'm excited to share my latest project â€“ a professional-grade AI voice chatbot that automates technical support and customer service calls using advanced Natural Language Processing.

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
ðŸ”¹ Voice Interaction: Real-time voice conversations using speech recognition and text-to-speech.

ðŸ”¹ Multi-Agent System: Specialized AI agents handle support queries, managed via an intelligent main orchestrator agent for context-aware, dynamic conversations.

ðŸ”¹ Context Retention: Tracks conversation history for smooth, human-like dialogue flow.

ðŸ”¹ Built with Python: Fully modular and scalable using OpenAI/Gemini APIs and agent SDK.

ðŸ”¹ Fully Customizable: Easy to expand with new agents, knowledge bases, or 3rd-party API integrations.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: Python, OpenAI / Gemini, Agents SDK, SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3 / gTTS

ðŸ’¬ This project helped me deepen my expertise in LLM orchestration, voice AI, and multi-agent collaboration.

ðŸ“¢ If you're building smart assistants or want to automate support workflows â€” Iâ€™d love to connect and collaborate!
